///  The interface creates anchors which keep track of the pose that
/// is fixed relative to the real world. With anchors, you can
/// specify poses in the world that need to be updated to correctly
/// reflect the evolving understanding of the world, such that the
/// poses remain aligned with the same place in the physical world.
/// That helps to build an illusion that the placed objects are
/// really present in the user's environment.
